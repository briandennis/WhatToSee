# React Rating

React Rating is a [react](https://github.com/facebook/react) rating component which supports custom symbols both with [inline styles](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html) and glyphicons found in popular CSS Toolkits like [Fontawesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) or [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/components/).

I intend to port the jQuery [bootstrap-rating](https://github.com/dreyescat/bootstrap-rating) to a React component.

## Demo

See [react-rating](http://dreyescat.github.io/react-rating/) in action.

## Installation

You can install `react-rating` component using the *npm* package manager:

```bash
npm install --save react-rating
```

### Dependencies

The `react-rating` component [peer depends](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#peerdependencies) on the [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) library.

You can install React using *npm* too:

```bash
npm install --save react
```

## Usage

1. Require the Rating Component

    ```javascript
    var Rating = require('react-rating');
    ```

2. Start using it

    With raw javascript:

    ```javascript
    React.createElement(Rating)
    ```

    Or with JSX:

    ```jsx
    <Rating />
    ```
